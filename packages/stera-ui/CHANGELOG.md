# stera-ui

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- [`3a94151`](https://github.com/hauntedjpeg/Stera-UI/commit/3a941510027a68a17cc5c72b5e07b549800880a9) Thanks [@hauntedjpeg](https://github.com/hauntedjpeg)! - Split the shipped stylesheet into concern-based partials.

  `init` now writes a `ui/` folder next to your `globals.css` instead of a single
  `stera-ui.css`:

  ```text
  styles/
  ├── globals.css          # yours — imports ui/index.css
  └── ui/
      ├── index.css        # wires the partials together
      ├── colors.css       # color tokens, light + dark
      ├── typography.css   # type tokens + st-* utilities
      ├── scrollbar.css
      ├── scroll-fade.css
      └── base.css
  ```

  - **Colors and typography are yours.** `add globals` refreshes the other
    partials in place but asks before replacing `ui/colors.css` or
    `ui/typography.css`, so theme edits and font setup survive a refresh. Pass
    `--overwrite` to take the registry version anyway. This fixes font variables
    and `@font-face` imports being silently reverted by `add globals`.
  - **Nothing is branded.** No shipped path contains `stera`, so the styles read
    as part of your project.
  - **Existing projects migrate automatically.** The first `add globals` after
    upgrading removes the old `stera-ui.css`, swaps its `@import` for
    `@import "./ui/index.css"`, and writes the `ui/` folder.

## 0.6.1

### Patch Changes

- [#53](https://github.com/hauntedjpeg/Stera-UI/pull/53) [`8e193d6`](https://github.com/hauntedjpeg/Stera-UI/commit/8e193d6264a1710c1f453439a258fcf6ffec4b8c) Thanks [@hauntedjpeg](https://github.com/hauntedjpeg)! - Fix orientation and pressed-state styling in registry components

  Several components used Tailwind variants that didn't match the data attributes Base UI actually emits, so the rules compiled to selectors that never matched:
  - **Scroll Area** — the scrollbar used `data-horizontal:` / `data-vertical:` variants and therefore rendered with no width or height. Now uses `data-[orientation=…]:`. Also adds a Scroll Area docs page and examples, which is why this went unnoticed.
  - **Toggle Group** — the root and item classNames used dead `data-vertical:` and `group-data-horizontal/toggle-group:` variants, breaking vertical layout and segmented corner rounding in both orientations. The selected-segment background used `data-[state=on]`, but Base UI's Toggle emits `data-pressed`.
  - **Toggle Group / Tabs** — both destructured `orientation` and re-emitted it only as a hand-written `data-orientation` attribute without forwarding it to the underlying primitive. Base UI's internal orientation state stayed `horizontal`, so vertical layouts had horizontal arrow-key navigation. The prop is now forwarded and Base UI emits `data-orientation` itself.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- [`8efb7e6`](https://github.com/hauntedjpeg/Stera-UI/commit/8efb7e6fc2fd62f4c5f899b9034c27c050fe9a3d) Thanks [@hauntedjpeg](https://github.com/hauntedjpeg)! - Performance and modernization pass on the CLI:
  - Registry items now resolve their dependency graph from the cached index and fetch all component files in parallel instead of one at a time.
  - Registry responses are validated against the zod schemas, with a 15s network timeout and clear error messages.
  - Commands load lazily, so `list` and `add` no longer pay the cost of loading the font tooling (ts-morph) used only by `init`.
  - `--version` now reports the real package version.
  - Missing components are reported all at once, and skipped files distinguish "unchanged" from "overwrite declined". Overwrite confirmation uses the same prompt UI as init.
  - Async errors exit with a clean one-line message instead of an unhandled rejection stack trace.
  - Node.js 20 is now the minimum supported version (Node 18 is end-of-life).

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- [`0723b61`](https://github.com/hauntedjpeg/Stera-UI/commit/0723b6138cb1019658db78902ecd91148f10126d) Thanks [@hauntedjpeg](https://github.com/hauntedjpeg)! - Rename the CLI config file from `components.json` to `stera.config.json`.

  `stera-ui init` now writes `stera.config.json`. Existing projects don't need to do anything — the CLI still reads `components.json` and prints a one-time deprecation warning telling you to rename. Running `stera-ui init` in a project that has the legacy filename will offer an inline rename. Legacy filename support will be removed in a future release.

  The hosted JSON schema URL (`https://ui.stera.sh/schema.json`) is unchanged.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [`bd67ccc`](https://github.com/hauntedjpeg/Stera-UI/commit/bd67ccce5cb569f43d5e8330bb6069838c158a6e) Thanks [@hauntedjpeg](https://github.com/hauntedjpeg)! - Unified CSS handling in the CLI around a single ownership model: the CLI writes CSS exactly once, at `init`, and hands it over to you.

  **What changed**
  - `stera-ui init` now always writes two files, regardless of whether you had an existing globals.css:
    - `stera-ui.css` — design tokens and typography utilities, written next to your globals.css. Yours to customize.
    - `globals.css` — either your existing file (touched once to add the `@import "./stera-ui.css";` line and any peer imports like `tw-animate-css`), or a minimal new file if you had none.
  - `stera-ui add <component>` never touches any CSS file. No warnings, no merges. Your customizations to `stera-ui.css` are preserved across component adds.
  - `stera-ui add globals` is now an explicit "refresh" command: it overwrites `stera-ui.css` with the latest registry content and does not prompt (use `git diff` to review). It does not touch `globals.css`.
  - `stera-ui add globals <other>` is rejected — run them separately.

  **Why**

  The previous flow had two init branches and a runtime warning in `add` when tokens were missing. Under the new model, `init` is the one and only moment the CLI writes CSS; from then on the file is yours. This makes customization safe and the mental model uniform.

  **Upgrade notes**
  - Existing projects with `components.json` are unaffected — `init` still short-circuits when already initialized.
  - Projects that were initialized under the old "no existing globals.css" branch have tokens inline in `globals.css` with no separate `stera-ui.css`. If you want to adopt the new layout, run `stera-ui add globals` to generate `stera-ui.css`, then move/remove the inline tokens from `globals.css` and add `@import "./stera-ui.css";`.

## 0.3.3

### Patch Changes

- [`68536e4`](https://github.com/hauntedjpeg/Stera-UI/commit/68536e402f53f962e446382ded27ac4d25bcf327) Thanks [@hauntedjpeg](https://github.com/hauntedjpeg)! - Fix `init` writing unresolvable `@/*` aliases into `components.json` on projects without matching tsconfig paths
  - `init` now reads `compilerOptions.paths` from the project's `tsconfig.json` and derives the alias prefix from it (e.g. `@` or `~`), matching shadcn's behavior. Vite/custom-prefix projects no longer get `@/…` aliases hardcoded.
  - When tsconfig has no paths (e.g. a references-only root tsconfig in a Figma plugin or some monorepo setups), `init` exits with a clear error pointing at the installation docs instead of writing a broken `components.json` that would scatter files at the repo root on subsequent `add` runs.
  - `resolveOutputPath` now throws with an actionable message when a configured alias can't be resolved against tsconfig, instead of silently stripping `@/` and writing files to the wrong place. Also fixes a case where `createMatchPath` would silently accept unmapped aliases.
  - `hasGlobalsCss` now also recognises Stera tokens inlined directly in the user's main CSS file (not just the sibling `stera-ui.css` partial), so re-running `init` on a hand-rolled setup no longer re-appends tokens.

## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- [`dfd8d6f`](https://github.com/hauntedjpeg/Stera-UI/commit/dfd8d6f548e84e2ac85ac85f7d567f651e9cac1e) Thanks [@hauntedjpeg](https://github.com/hauntedjpeg)! - Show a loading spinner while the CLI fetches from the registry
  - `stera-ui add`, `stera-ui list`, and `stera-ui init` now display the existing `• ✦ ✶ ✻` spinner during registry network calls, closing the 0.5–2s silent window where users couldn't tell if the command was running
  - Network failures transition the spinner to `✗ Failed to fetch registry` instead of leaking an in-progress animation
  - Moved the globals-CSS warning in `add` to after the spinner resolves so it no longer corrupts the single-line render

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- [`de2d6e7`](https://github.com/hauntedjpeg/Stera-UI/commit/de2d6e771cd940656d82598958c5499198017020) Thanks [@hauntedjpeg](https://github.com/hauntedjpeg)! - Prevent duplicate `@import` declarations when initializing in a project with an existing CSS file
  - `stera-ui.css` no longer contains `@import` lines; required imports (e.g. `tw-animate-css`) are added to the user's main CSS instead
  - `insertImportLine` now skips imports that already exist, preventing duplicates across init and font setup

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [`c7a7313`](https://github.com/hauntedjpeg/Stera-UI/commit/c7a731375d1638b14f605cb7513fc9742fa8a15b) Thanks [@hauntedjpeg](https://github.com/hauntedjpeg)! - Adopt shadcn's registry-driven font strategy for init
  - Added `registry:font` type to the registry schema with font metadata (family, provider, variable, subsets, dependency)
  - Font setup during `init` now uses `@fontsource-variable/*` packages for non-Next.js projects and `next/font/google` with AST-based layout patching (via ts-morph) for Next.js projects, replacing the previous approach of copying woff2 files to `public/fonts/`
  - Renamed CSS variables: `--font-display` to `--font-heading`, `--font-body` to `--font-sans` to align with Tailwind/shadcn conventions
  - Removed `setup-fonts-nextjs.ts`, `setup-fonts-generic.ts`, and `copy-fonts.ts` in favor of the new `update-fonts.ts` module
  - Globals CSS no longer depends on a separate `fonts.css` file

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- [`30e3d8f`](https://github.com/hauntedjpeg/Stera-UI/commit/30e3d8f549324ed3c031fc82d63acf8b02457e29) Thanks [@hauntedjpeg](https://github.com/hauntedjpeg)! - Show a friendly error message when running init in a pnpm workspace root instead of a raw stack trace

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [`3cfe1ad`](https://github.com/hauntedjpeg/Stera-UI/commit/3cfe1ad40e0e0ac0889eec00e4f8c21fb20e0e1b) Thanks [@hauntedjpeg](https://github.com/hauntedjpeg)! - Overhaul font strategy in `stera-ui init` for modern, performant defaults
  - Detect existing font usage (next/font, @font-face, Google Fonts) during init
  - Prompt users to keep their current fonts, adopt Stera UI defaults (Geist), or skip
  - For Next.js projects, optionally configure `next/font` via the `geist` npm package for automatic optimization, preloading, and self-hosting
  - For non-Next.js projects, copy self-hosted woff2 files from the `geist` package to `public/fonts/` and provide preload link tags
  - Record font strategy choice in `components.json` for future reference
  - Fonts now work immediately after init with no manual download steps

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- [`149a5f0`](https://github.com/hauntedjpeg/Stera-UI/commit/149a5f0f91561851f2ea8a6299af924af1a5cf8a) Thanks [@hauntedjpeg](https://github.com/hauntedjpeg)! - Fix package manager detection in monorepos and surface install errors
  - Use `@antfu/ni` for lock file detection, which walks up the directory tree to find lock files at the monorepo root
  - Add `npm_config_user_agent` fallback for cases like `pnpm dlx` where no lock file exists in the working directory
  - Replace `spawn` with `execa` so package manager errors are visible to the user instead of being swallowed

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- [`3b5fc16`](https://github.com/hauntedjpeg/Stera-UI/commit/3b5fc163ac1854cedc27d063fd2924678ac44f60) Thanks [@hauntedjpeg](https://github.com/hauntedjpeg)! - Update registry and schema URLs from ui.stera.site to ui.stera.sh

### Patch Changes

- [`5a98702`](https://github.com/hauntedjpeg/Stera-UI/commit/5a987026adcbd8ca94afe99f47792aeccdec4a04) Thanks [@hauntedjpeg](https://github.com/hauntedjpeg)! - Fix CLI crash caused by duplicate shebang in dist/index.js. Split CLI entrypoint into separate dist/cli.js so the bin and library exports no longer conflict.
